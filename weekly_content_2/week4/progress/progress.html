  <p>This week, I didn’t make major progress on my gamified navigation project for the workbook, but I focused on preparing for upcoming activities and experimenting with the topics covered in class. I completed both the in-class exercises and the homework tasks, which included creating a portrait using shapes and a Yayoi Kusama-inspired sketch.</p>
  <p>For my game, I’ve decided to enlarge the map for this submission. I’m also rethinking the concept. Instead of creating a completely new game for each submission, which may be too ambitious given the limited time, I’m considering introducing a new arena or theme within the current framework. Learning from my past experience, I’ve realised that I need to dedicate more time to developing and refining the content itself.</p>

        I redesigned the entire map of the game to make this arena a more challenging level than the previous one. The map is now larger, with additional routes that increase the chances of players getting stuck. Most of these changes were made in the createPaths() function within the setup() block of the p5.js code.

        I also made the screen shown bigger, by showing more cols and rows, as the previos game was too zoomed in.

      <p class="description">following along Patt, she first codes the board to get the grid of tictactoe game, then she finds the position where the player input is going to be and then uses an if function to leave the board blank if j and i value is zero. she essentially covers all the functions needed to create the game.</p>

        Yayoi Kusama Love Foever, silkscreen on canvas, is part of her 21st century artworks. I really enjoyed her exhibition it was so inspiring and a fun experience. This style in love forever really strikes out to me as it is quite different from her neon bright colours.
