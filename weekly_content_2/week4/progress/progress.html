  <p>This week, I didn’t make major progress on my gamified navigation project for the workbook, but I focused on preparing for upcoming activities and experimenting with the topics covered in class. I completed both the in-class exercises and the homework tasks, which included creating a portrait using shapes and a Yayoi Kusama-inspired sketch.</p>
  <p>For my game, I’ve decided to enlarge the map for this submission. I’m also rethinking the concept. Instead of creating a completely new game for each submission, which may be too ambitious given the limited time, I’m considering introducing a new arena or theme within the current framework. Learning from my past experience, I’ve realised that I need to dedicate more time to developing and refining the content itself.</p>

        I redesigned the entire map of the game to make this arena a more challenging level than the previous one. The map is now larger, with additional routes that increase the chances of players getting stuck. Most of these changes were made in the createPaths() function within the setup() block of the p5.js code.

        I also made the screen shown bigger, by showing more cols and rows, as the previos game was too zoomed in.

        Using Illustrator and Photoshop, I made the map pixel illustration to be put on top of the grid.

        This is the final set up of the map and sizing of the camera that shows a section of the map. rows is 5 and cols is 9.

        Apart from the map I made a background just in case I needed it. However, later on I decided to remove the platforms and make the opacity smaller.
