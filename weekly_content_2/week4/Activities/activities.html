      <p class="description">following along Patt, she first codes the board to get the grid of tictactoe game, then she finds the position where the player input is going to be and then uses an if function to leave the board blank if j and i value is zero. she essentially covers all the functions needed to create the game.</p>

    I think this is really cool with how the amount of lines is defined by how close the cursor is to the text.

     Yayoi Kusama Love Foever, silkscreen on canvas, is part of her 21st century artworks. I really enjoyed her exhibition it was so inpiring and a fun experience. This style in love forever really strikes out to me as it is quite different from her neon bright colours.</p>

     I was drawn to this artwork by Yayoi as I see a trend of overcrowding in her art which evokes a sense of stifling confinement.</p>
