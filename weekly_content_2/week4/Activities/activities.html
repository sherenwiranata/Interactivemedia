        First Kusama Sketch I did. This sketch is heavily inspired by kusama's use of bright neon colours and repeition of circles. Since in class we learnt about drawing shapes I thought it would be nice to have random coloured circles everytime we refresh the page.

              This p5.js sketch is a reinterpretation of the classic tic-tac-toe game, inspired by Yayoi Kusama’s Genesis, a work comprising densely packed square containers filled with seemingly random objects. In my sketch, each move isn't marked by a single symbol but by an overcrowding of 2–5 different shapes, visually echoing the overwhelming chaos found in Kusama's piece.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cluttered design reflects the suffocating nature of societal pressures, how individual expression can become lost within structures that feel predetermined and oppressive. By turning the act of play into a visual metaphor, the player is invited to “beat the system” through strategy, despite the confusion and noise built into the design. This sketch explores the tension between personal agency and external expectations, using the familiar format of a game to provoke reflection on broader social structures.
            </p>
            <p>
              This sketch was developed using the p5.js library, with guidance from Patt Vira’s YouTube tutorials and some troubleshooting support from ChatGPT throughout the debugging process.
