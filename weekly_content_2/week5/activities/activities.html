      <h1>Slave To the Algorithm</h1>

      <p class="description">
        This week we did the SLAVE TO THE ALGORITHM challenge, where for 12 hours, at least 10 of our daily decisions had to be made by chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of using a die or spinning wheel, I gave the challenge a twist by asking ChatGPT to pick random numbers. Each number matched a task I had pre-assigned, letting the AI dictate what I did. It followed the same mechanics as a spin-the-wheel game, so I created one in p5.js to visualise the concept of chance. You can even use it yourself to help decide something too!
      </p>
      <p>
        this spin the wheel is heavily guided by coding train AKA Dan Schiffman.
