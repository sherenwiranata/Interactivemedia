  <p>This week, I added a hint and guide button to my game page to improve user navigation. I also explored the Week 5 content by building on the in-class activity using a filtered camera cursor specifically the POSTERIZE filter, which reminded me of film camera aesthetics. This inspired me to frame this week’s theme around film cameras and metaphors that reflect their visual style.</p>
  <p>I also started thinking of a new gameplay concept differing from my first maze game where each coin represents a random portal to the weekly content this time i want a count so people have to collect 3 gems to get to the next page.

        In this stage, I focused on designing and implementing three key interactive buttons in my game interface: the Hint, Guide, and Play Music buttons. These buttons are part of the floating nav bar and allow users to get help or toggle the game’s background music.

        In this stage, I focused on designing and implementing three key interactive buttons in my game interface: the Hint, Guide, and Play Music buttons. These buttons are part of the floating nav bar and allow users to get help or toggle the game’s background music. While exploring the p5.js library, I came across the showPopup method, which helped me display images and messages in response to user actions. This discovery made it easier to present in-game guides and hints in a non-intrusive way. I also used ChatGPT to help debug some parts of the implementation and deepen my understanding of how things like mousePressed() and conditional rendering work in p5. Prompting ChatGPT to explain certain features gave me a clearer idea of how to manage visibility toggles and combine logic with visual feedback.

        One of the hardest but most interesting parts was implementing background music with the Play Music button. I experimented with loadSound() and .loop() from p5.js:. Key lesson learned: Browsers block autoplay sound unless there’s a user interaction. This tripped me up a lot , at first I was frustrated that sometimes the music wouldn’t play when I refreshed the page. I reflected back on my earlier Kusama sketch and realised that sound needs to be triggered by user input.I also studied the Healing Forest p5 sketch and saw how they delayed sound loading until a click occurred. This inspired me to add a clear toggle interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        While working on these interactions, I also implemented a dynamic Gem Counter (#gem-counter) that updates when the player collects coins.Once all 3 gems are collected, a popup appears and offers the option to teleport to a new scene.

            After exploring the different camera filters during the in-class tutorial, I found myself particularly drawn to the posterize filter. I liked how it simplified the colors and gave the visuals a bold, graphic quality.

             Here's the final page. Using the posterise filter as an inpiration, I created the page in theme of film cameras.
