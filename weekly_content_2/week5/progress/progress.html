  <p>This week, I added a hint and guide button to my game page to improve user navigation. I also explored the Week 5 content by building on the in-class activity using a filtered camera cursor specifically the POSTERIZE filter, which reminded me of film camera aesthetics. This inspired me to frame this week’s theme around film cameras and metaphors that reflect their visual style.</p>
  <p>as it reminds me of a film camera. Therefore i decided to make this week’s theme in relation to film cameras and metaphor that represents them. I also started thinking of a new gameplay concept differing from my first maze game where each coin represents a random portal to the weekly content this time i want a count so people have to collect 3 gems to get to the next page.

        I redesigned the entire map of the game to make this arena a more challenging level than the previous one. The map is now larger, with additional routes that increase the chances of players getting stuck. Most of these changes were made in the createPaths() function within the setup() block of the p5.js code.

        I also made the screen shown bigger, by showing more cols and rows, as the previos game was too zoomed in.

        Using Illustrator and Photoshop, I made the map pixel illustration to be put on top of the grid.

        This is the final set up of the map and sizing of the camera that shows a section of the map. rows is 5 and cols is 9.

        Apart from the map I made a background just in case I needed it. However, later on I decided to remove the platforms and make the opacity smaller.
