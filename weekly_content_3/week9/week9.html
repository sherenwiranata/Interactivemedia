              A robot that choreographs and ignites fireworks in precise sequences, blending technology and art to create spectacular visual performances. I’m inspired by Shimon because it beautifully blends human creativity with robotic intelligence in a collaborative musical performance. What fascinates me most is how Shimon listens, learns, and improvises in real time alongside human musicians, breaking the typical one-way interaction we expect from machines. This challenges the idea of robots as mere tools and instead presents them as creative partners. The key takeaway for me is how technology can amplify and complement human expression rather than replace it, opening new possibilities for co-creation and emotional connection between humans and robots.

          The Sound Shirt by CuteCircuit is a wearable technology designed to let deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals experience music through touch. At first, the concept sounds almost absurd, how can a shirt let you “feel” sound? But the more I learned about it, the more I was amazed. The shirt translates different parts of a musical composition into vibrations across the torso and arms, allowing the wearer to physically sense sound. I find this incredibly inspiring because it makes something as intangible as music accessible to people who otherwise might never experience it. It’s a beautiful example of inclusive design, innovative, empathetic, and focused on a group often left out of conversations around technology and experiencing sound.

        Dances of the Sacred and Profane is an interactive dance performance that merges choreography with real-time motion capture and generative visuals. Created by Camille Utterback in collaboration with choreographer Mark Foehringer, the piece uses a physical computing system, to translate dancers' movements into dynamic visual and sound outputs. On-stage cameras track the performers, turning their physical gestures into molecular simulations projected on large screens.
        I find this work really inspiring because it shows how physical computing can be used to create deeply immersive, poetic experiences. Rather than using sensors for utility or control, this piece transforms human movement into art. It highlights how data from the body, like motion and positioning, can drive rich visual and auditory environments. I’m especially drawn to the way it treats the dancer’s body as both input and artwork, blending technology with expression in a way that feels alive and emotional.
