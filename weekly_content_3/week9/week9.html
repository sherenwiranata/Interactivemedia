          Watching and learning about the Pat Me robot really moved me, especially in how it reimagines emotional comfort and human connection through physical computing. I was drawn to the reciprocal nature of the interaction: the robot won’t pat you unless you pat it first. It flips the usual expectation of machines as passive tools and instead suggests that relationships, whether human or robotic, should be mutual, not one-sided. I tend to think about interaction design in terms of utility or function, but Pat Me reminded me that emotional nuance and vulnerability can be central, too. I also really admire the sensitivity behind the concept: it was created in response to loneliness, but it doesn’t try to "fix" that feeling with generic comfort. Instead, it invites dialogue and awareness, both with the self and with others. It’s inspiring to see how something as simple as a pat can become a symbolic act of care, trust, and reciprocity, all made possible through prototyping and experimentation.

          The “Nightjar” by Kelly Heaton really inspires me because it shows how something as technical as analog circuitry can be used to create lifelike, organic sound. What I find especially fascinating is that it’s completely analog, no digital components, no sound recordings, just raw electronics shaping sound through oscillators and filters. It feels almost magical that by turning a few knobs, you can create birdsong that sounds alive. I love that it bridges art, science, and sound in such a hands-on, expressive way. It’s also cool that it’s not just an artwork but an instrument, Heaton built in line-out and remote control options so musicians and makers can experiment and play.

        "Pulse Room" by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer is an interactive light installation that transforms something as invisible and internal as a heartbeat into a shared, visual experience. At first, the idea of a room full of light bulbs flashing with people’s pulses sounds simple, but the more I learned about it, the more powerful it became. The installation senses a participant’s heartbeat and causes a nearby bulb to flash in sync with it. When the person lets go, their pulse is recorded and pushed through a queue of lights, forming a glowing sequence of human rhythms. I find this incredibly inspiring because it turns raw biometric data into something poetic, collective, and even emotional. It makes people feel both individually seen and part of a larger flow. Connecting bodies, light, memory, and time. It’s a beautiful example of how physical computing can be used not just for function, but for meaning, making the unseen seen and creating a deeply human interaction through technology."
