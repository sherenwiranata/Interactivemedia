          In this class activity, we created a circuit where a photoresistor detects light levels and triggers a servo motor to move. As light intensity changes, the servo responds by rotating to a new position.
          This exercise introduced how sensors and actuators can interact to create responsive systems. A key takeaway for me was realizing how real-world inputs like light can drive motion, opening up possibilities for playful or functional interactions, ike machines that follow sunlight or respond to environmental changes.

          Similar to the photoresistor-controlled servo motor, this activity demonstrates how a photoresistor can also produce a sound output. It highlights how environmental input like light can be translated into different forms of sensory feedback, such as sound.

          This activity is a capacitive music machine that uses touch-sensitive inputs to create sound. Unlike typical setups that use a piezo speaker, I used a magnetic speaker because I didn’t realize they were different. Both look quite similar from the top. Throughout the process, I kept wondering why others had such lovely sounds from their machines while mine just screeched. This experience taught me how important it is to choose the right hardware for sound quality and how speaker type can dramatically affect the outcome.

          After hearing that loud screeching sound, we looked into it and figured out what was wrong. Once we swapped the speaker for a better one, the sound became way nicer to listen to. I really like how this project turns touch into music it’s kind of like a quirky little piano made by a fairy.
