            In this class activity, we created a circuit where a photoresistor detects light levels and triggers a servo motor to move. As light intensity changes, the servo responds by rotating to a new position.
            This exercise introduced how sensors and actuators can interact to create responsive systems. A key takeaway for me was realizing how real-world inputs like light can drive motion, opening up possibilities for playful or functional interactions, ike machines that follow sunlight or respond to environmental changes.
