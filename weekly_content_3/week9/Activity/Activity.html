            Before using p5.js, we first tested the circuit with Arduino IDE using the code provided in milanote allowed us to confirm the circuit was working correctly. As seen in the video, the circuit is properly connected. Turning the potentiometer changes the values displayed in the Serial Monitor, indicating that the input is being read and transmitted as expected.

          I struggled with the Processing app, I didnâ€™t realise I could just use VS Code, so I kept trying to download Processing, but it only loaded Java, not p5. The picture above are my files I opened in VS code to do this as I couldnt use the processing app.

          I finally got everything working after a series of missteps and troubleshooting. One key issue was that a separate Serial Monitor from the Arduino IDE was still open, which interfered with the connection and prevented my p5.js sketch from running properly. After closing the conflicting tabs and ensuring only one serial connection was active, the sketch began to work as intended. As shown in the video above, turning the potentiometer now correctly affects the size of the circle in the p5.js canvas.
