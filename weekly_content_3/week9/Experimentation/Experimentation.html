        <p class="activity-description">
          The Reverse Microwave is a playful Chindogu invention, a completely unnecessary machine that cools your food down, even though you could just wait for it to cool naturally. Inspired by a servo motor activity, I started thinking about how fans could be used in a useless-yet-functional way. The idea is simple: when you place a hot meal on the device, heat sensors detect the temperature and trigger DC motors to spin small fans, blowing air to cool the food. At the same time, the food sits on a rotating piece of cardboard powered by a motor, ensuring it cools evenly from all sides. Once the sensors no longer detect heat, everything shuts off automatically and your now-cold meal is ready to eat. It’s mildly effective, over-engineered, and delightfully absurd, just the way a proper Chindogu should be.

        <img src="./img/Birdspy.jpg" alt="Another Activity" class="activity-image" />
        <p class="activity-description">
          Bird Spy is an absurd surveillance device that imagines what birds might be saying if we could understand them. Designed to perch on a tree or balcony ledge, the gadget listens for nearby chirps and birdsong using a small microphone. When it detects bird sounds, it activates a speculative translation algorithm that converts the chirps into humorous or dramatic human phrases , all displayed live on your laptop. The translations are intentionally inaccurate and emotionally exaggerated, turning nature’s background noise into a stream of imagined gossip, existential complaints, and bird-sized drama. Think: “She stole my branch again,” or “The worms are late today.” While totally impractical, Bird Spy reflects on our desire to decode the natural world and projects our own anxieties onto it, all through a tiny machine pretending to understand birds.
