      <p class="activity-description">
        Here I added a new card to represent the third game or portal to the 2C workbook. Here the game name and descipriton is inspired by the workbook's content which is physical computing.

        <p class="activity-description">
          For this workbook I want to focus on the development of my content pages therefore I needed a fun and quick solution to replace the game as I want to explore other possibilites to navigate to the workbook. Thus, I came up with the idea of a glitch in the game. The design of the error page is inpspired by "Among Us".

          <h2 class="activity-title">Above: Glitch Animation</h2>
            <p class="activity-description">
              After learning about the setTimeout function in JavaScript, I decided to experiment with it to create a transition portal between the game selection and the workbook content. I initially considered adding a glitch animation, which could be enhanced with a sound effect. One possible solution was to move the glitch animation to the card selection page, triggering both the animation and the sound upon click before redirecting to the error page. However, since this workbook prioritizes content over interactivity or p5.js-based features, I concluded that it would be more effective and efficient to focus my time on completing the content section of the workbook itself.

        <h2 class="activity-title">Above: Back To Analog Portal</h2>
        <p class="activity-description">
          Lastly, I created a "Back to Analog" page inspired by the page that pops up when there is an error and site can't be reached in chrome, digitalising the design with pixelya font since at this point in the narrative users stil has not left the digital world.
