        <p class="activity-description">
          As someone who constantly procrastinates because of my phone-scrolling addiction, I started thinking, how fun would it be to have a goofy little contraption that literally puts your phone in jail? I always try to hide my phone in a drawer, but the next minute I’m back at it, watching another brain-rotting video.
          One thing that does snap me back to reality is when someone reminds me of all the things I have to do, my goals for the week, deadlines, aspirations in life. That kind of pressure and anxiety is exactly what I need sometimes to get moving.
          So, I sketched out a phone jail that brings both ideas together. You lock your phone inside, and there's a distance sensor at the opening. If it detects if anything is getting too close, like you're hand attempting to snatch your phone, a speaker activates and reminds you of your goals and the tasks you should be working on instead. It’s like a funny but firm accountability buddy in gadget form.

        <p class="activity-description">
          ROBOPP – aka Your Biggest Opp (Opponent/Hater) Robot. Inspired by the social media term “opp”—meaning someone who’s always against you, your hater, your nemesis. I created ROBOPP: not your friend, not your helper, but your biggest opposition.
          While robots like Baymax are built to be sweet, caring, and supportive, ROBOPP is the exact opposite. I wanted to design a robot that's intentionally annoying, insufferable, and just downright frustrating to be around.
          ROBOPP listens to what you say and immediately contradicts it—no matter what. If you say, “The sky is so blue today,” it’ll snap back with, “The sky’s not even blue, what are you talking about?” Say, “Donuts are so good,” and it’ll hit you with, “Nah, hotdogs are better.” It’s like having a walking comment section full of bad takes—except it’s real, and it’s right next to you.
