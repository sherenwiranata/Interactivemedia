              Sisters with Transistors was one of the "hunt and gather" materials for Week 7. Watching the documentary, I was inspired by how these pioneering women embraced experimentation fearlessly, using tools like oscillators, synthesizers, and tape loops to invent entirely new sounds. I tend to be quite conservative in my creative process, often staying within my comfort zone. I’ve noticed I can be quick to close off possibilities before fully exploring them. This documentary served as a reminder to stay open, curious, and willing to experiment, even when the outcome is uncertain.

        <h2 class="activity-title">THE TRUMPET OF THE SWAN</h2>
        <img src="./img/trumpet.jpeg" alt="Activity Image" class="activity-image" />
        <p class="activity-description">
          “The Trumpet of the Swan” by Karen Ann Donnachie and Andy Simionato is a project that merges robotic art, political commentary, and literary metaphor to explore how we engage with digital speech, authorship, and the permanence of public discourse in the age of automation.
          What I found especially compelling is how the project critically reflects on Donald Trump's prolific use of Twitter (now X) during his presidency. As someone who is chronically online, I often come across Trump’s tweets and scroll past them without thinking twice. This project gives those fleeting posts a kind of weight and permanence, transforming them into something that invites reflection.
          I love how the artists add a deeper, metaphorical layer to his tweets. On the surface, it looks like an elegant swan gracefully writing. But once you realize the actual content being transcribed—Trump's often chaotic or blunt posts—the contrast becomes both poetic and hilarious. The juxtaposition between the refined, machine-cursive handwriting and Trump’s brash online persona really elevates the project, turning digital noise into a thought-provoking physical artifact.

        <h2 class="activity-title">THE BLIND ROBOT</h2>
        <img src="./img/theblindrobot.jpg" alt="Another Activity" class="activity-image" />
        <p class="activity-description">
          “Blind Robot” challenges traditional human-machine dynamics by placing the robot in a leading, exploratory role, while the human becomes the passive subject. It raises questions about trust, intimacy, and the blurred boundaries between organic and mechanical interaction.
            I really like how this piece flips the usual expectation that humans are the ones in control. There’s something both eerie and tender about letting a robot explore your face, almost as if it's trying to understand you. It makes me rethink the way we often view machines as purely functional or emotionless. In this work, the robot's actions feel strangely human, even compassionate.
            Although the piece is from 2014, it feels increasingly relevant today. With the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and apps that offer AI friends or companions, this idea of human-like interaction with machines has become more widespread. At first, it might seem exciting or novel, but I think it also opens up a darker side. For younger or more vulnerable users, relying on AI for emotional connection can lead to isolation or unhealthy relationships with technology. It can create echo chambers that reinforce negative thinking or even contribute to toxic online subcultures. This work makes me reflect on those risks in a quiet but powerful way.
